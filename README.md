### If a person is infected by the disease, the probability of a positive test result will be 90%. However, if someone is not infected, there still will have 9% chances to get the positive result. We have already known that the prevalence of this disease is 1%. 

## If I am tested to be positive, what is the probability of getting a true infection?
## 70%?
## 60%?
## 50%?
## 40%?
## 10%?






## Answer
Just **9%**, the key is not the reliability of the test but the prevalence of this disease
